# === Commit Logic ===
The commit removes a large block of redundant comments at the end of the `new-server.py` file. These comments reiterated the server's functionality, its interaction with hardware, API endpoints, CORS configuration, and deployment details. The removal aims to clean up the code and avoid duplication, as this information is better conveyed through proper code documentation or a separate README.

# === Code Style Feedback ===
Here's a summary of the code review:

*   **Error Handling:** Implement `try...except` blocks, especially around GPIO interactions.
*   **Global Variables:** Encapsulate encoder logic within a class to avoid global variables.
*   **CORS:** Use specific origins instead of `*` for production.
*   **Comments:** Remove redundant comments at the end of the script.
*   **Value Constraints:** Consolidate value constraint logic in `show_value` and `get_value`.
*   **Debug Mode:** Disable debug mode in production.
*   **Naming:** Rename `api_reset` to a more descriptive name like `reset_encoder_value`.
*   **Logging:** Utilize the imported `logging` module for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Redundant Imports:** Remove unused imports: `threading`, `time`, `os`, `sys`, and `signal`.
*   **Race Conditions:** Address potential race conditions when accessing and modifying `current_value`.
*   **Encoder Steps:** Avoid directly manipulating `encoder.steps`.
*   **Shutdown Mechanism:** Implement a proper shutdown mechanism for the Flask app.

# === Static Analysis Feedback ===
The code has potential race conditions due to shared mutable state (`current_value`, `encoder.steps`) between the interrupt handler and API endpoints. The CORS configuration uses a wildcard, posing a security risk. There is a lack of error handling around GPIO operations. Unused imports bloat the code. Value constraints are duplicated. Debug mode is enabled in the production environment. The function name `api_reset` is not descriptive. The logging import is unused.
Consider using a more specific CORS origin, implementing proper error handling, encapsulating encoder logic in a class, consolidating value constraints, disabling debug mode in production, renaming `api_reset` to something more descriptive, and adding logging. Remove unused imports.
