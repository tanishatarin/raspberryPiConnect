# === Commit Logic ===
The commit removes a large block of redundant comments at the end of the `new-server.py` file. These comments reiterated information about the server's functionality, API endpoints, hardware interaction, and deployment details, which should be documented elsewhere or be self-evident from the code itself. Removing the comments improves code readability and reduces unnecessary duplication.

# === Code Style Feedback ===
Here's a summary of the code review:

*   **Error Handling:** Implement `try...except` blocks, especially around GPIO interactions.
*   **Global Variables:** Encapsulate encoder logic within a class to avoid global variables.
*   **CORS:** Use specific origins instead of `*` for production.
*   **Comments:** Remove redundant comments at the end of the script.
*   **Value Constraints:** Consolidate min/max value constraint logic.
*   **Debug Mode:** Disable debug mode in production.
*   **Naming:** Rename `api_reset` to a more descriptive name like `reset_encoder_value`.
*   **Logging:** Utilize the imported `logging` module for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Redundant Imports:** Remove unused imports: `threading`, `time`, `os`, `sys`, and `signal`.
*   **Race Conditions:** Address potential race conditions when accessing and modifying `current_value`.
*   **Encoder Manipulation:** Avoid directly manipulating `encoder.steps`.
*   **Shutdown Mechanism:** Implement a proper shutdown mechanism for the Flask app.

# === Static Analysis Feedback ===
The code has potential issues with race conditions when accessing `current_value` from both the interrupt handler and API endpoints. The direct manipulation of `encoder.steps` could lead to unexpected behavior. The CORS configuration is overly permissive. Error handling is lacking for GPIO operations. There's no proper shutdown mechanism for the Flask app. Redundant imports should be removed. The value constraints are duplicated. Debug mode should be disabled in production. The function name `api_reset` could be more descriptive. The logging import is not used.
