# === Commit Logic ===
The commit removes a large block of comments at the end of the `new-server.py` file. These comments were redundant, repeating information about the server's functionality, its interaction with a rotary encoder and button, its API endpoints, CORS configuration, Raspberry Pi deployment, and debug mode setting. Removing these comments cleans up the code and reduces redundancy, as this information should ideally be conveyed through proper code documentation and potentially a separate README file.

# === Code Style Feedback ===
Here's a summary of the code review:

*   **Error Handling:** The code lacks comprehensive error handling. Consider adding `try...except` blocks, especially around GPIO interactions, to prevent crashes.
*   **Global Variables:** The use of global variables (`current_value`) can lead to maintainability issues. Consider encapsulating the encoder logic within a class.
*   **CORS:** While CORS is implemented, consider more specific origins instead of `*` for production.
*   **Comments:** The comments at the end of the script are redundant and should be removed.
*   **Value Constraints:** The value constraints (min/max) are duplicated in `show_value` and `get_value`. Consolidate this logic.
*   **Debug Mode:** Disable debug mode (`debug=False`) in production.
*   **Naming:** The function name `api_reset` could be more descriptive, such as `reset_encoder_value`.
*   **Logging:** The logging import is not used. Consider adding logging for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Redundant Imports:** The imports `threading`, `time`, `os`, `sys` and `signal` are not used and should be removed.

# === Static Analysis Feedback ===
The code may have issues due to the parsing error. There are potential race conditions when accessing and modifying `current_value` from both the rotary encoder's interrupt handler (`show_value`) and the API endpoints (`get_value`, `api_reset`). The `encoder.steps` is being directly manipulated which could lead to unexpected behavior if the hardware updates it asynchronously. The CORS configuration is overly permissive, allowing requests from any origin which is a security risk. The code lacks error handling for GPIO operations, which could fail if the pins are already in use or misconfigured. There is no proper shutdown mechanism for the Flask app, which could lead to resource leaks. The comments at the end of the script are redundant and don't add value.
