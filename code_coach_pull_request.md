# === Commit Logic ===
The commit removes a large block of comments at the end of the `new-server.py` file. These comments were redundant, repeating the same information about the server's functionality, intended platform (Raspberry Pi), and debug mode. Removing them cleans up the code and reduces unnecessary verbosity.

# === Code Style Feedback ===
Here's a summary of the code's style and potential improvements:

*   **Error Handling:** The AST parsing error indicates a fundamental issue. The code might not be valid Python, or the parser is misconfigured.
*   **CORS:** The CORS implementation is overly permissive (`'*'`). Consider restricting it to specific origins for security.
*   **Global Variables:** Excessive use of `global` variables (`current_value`) can lead to maintainability issues. Encapsulate the encoder logic within a class to manage state.
*   **Value Clamping:** The value clamping logic (`max(30, min(encoder.steps, 200))`) is repeated. Consolidate it into a function or property.
*   **Comments:** The comments at the end of the file are redundant and verbose. Focus on concise, meaningful comments within the code.
*   **Debug Mode:** Disable `debug=True` in production.
*   **Naming:** `api_reset` could be named `reset_api` for consistency.
*   **Redundant Comments:** Remove the redundant comments at the end of the file.

# === Static Analysis Feedback ===
The code has a parsing error, indicating potential syntax issues. There might be inconsistencies in how the `current_value` is updated and used, especially with the global scope. Consider thread safety when updating `current_value` and `encoder.steps` due to the threaded nature of Flask. Ensure proper error handling and logging, especially for GPIO operations. The CORS configuration is overly permissive (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'`) and should be restricted in a production environment.
