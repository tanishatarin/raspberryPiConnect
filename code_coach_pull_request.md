# === Commit Logic ===
The commit removes a large block of comments at the end of the `new-server.py` file. These comments were redundant, repeating the same information about the server's functionality, intended platform (Raspberry Pi), and debug mode. Removing them cleans up the code and reduces unnecessary verbosity.

# === Code Style Feedback ===
Here's a summary of the code's style and potential improvements:

*   **Error Handling:** The AST parsing error indicates potential syntax issues or code that the parser doesn't recognize.
*   **CORS:** The CORS implementation is functional but overly permissive (`'*'`). Consider restricting it to specific origins for security.
*   **Global Variables:** Excessive use of `global` variables (`current_value`) can make code harder to maintain. Encapsulate state within a class.
*   **Value Clamping:** The value clamping logic (`max(30, min(encoder.steps, 200))`) is repeated. Consolidate this into a function or property.
*   **Comments:** The extensive comments at the end of the file are redundant and should be removed.
*   **Debug Mode:** Ensure `debug=False` is set for production.
*   **Naming:** The name `api_reset` could be more descriptive (e.g., `reset_encoder`).
*   **Redundant Comments:** The comments at the end of the script are repetitive and don't add significant value. Remove them.
*   **State Management:** Consider using a class to encapsulate the encoder and button logic, improving state management and reducing the need for global variables.

# === Static Analysis Feedback ===
The code may have issues due to the parsing error. There are potential race conditions when accessing and modifying `current_value` from both the Flask routes and the rotary encoder's event handler. The `current_value` might not always reflect the actual encoder steps due to the separate updates. The `encoder.steps` is directly modified by the hardware, and `current_value` is updated based on it, but the updates are not atomic. The code lacks proper error handling for GPIO operations. If the GPIO pins are not configured correctly or if there are issues with the rotary encoder or button, the program might crash. The CORS configuration is overly permissive, allowing requests from any origin. This could pose a security risk. The code does not handle any exceptions that might occur during the API calls. The comments at the end of the file are redundant and do not add any value.
Consider using a lock to synchronize access to `current_value` and `encoder.steps`. Implement error handling for GPIO operations. Restrict the allowed origins in the CORS configuration. Add exception handling to the API routes. Remove the redundant comments.
