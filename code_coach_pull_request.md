# === Commit Logic ===
The commit removes a large block of redundant comments at the end of the `new-server.py` file. These comments reiterated the server's functionality, its interaction with hardware, API endpoints, CORS configuration, and deployment details, which are better conveyed through proper code documentation or a separate README. Removing these comments improves code cleanliness and reduces unnecessary repetition.

# === Code Style Feedback ===
Here's a summary of the code review:

*   **Error Handling:** Implement `try...except` blocks, especially around GPIO interactions.
*   **Global Variables:** Encapsulate encoder logic within a class to avoid global variables.
*   **CORS:** Use specific origins instead of `*` for production.
*   **Comments:** Remove redundant comments at the end of the script.
*   **Value Constraints:** Consolidate value constraint logic in `show_value` and `get_value`.
*   **Debug Mode:** Disable debug mode in production.
*   **Naming:** Rename `api_reset` to something more descriptive like `reset_encoder_value`.
*   **Logging:** Utilize the imported `logging` module for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Redundant Imports:** Remove unused imports: `threading`, `time`, `os`, `sys`, and `signal`.
*   **Race Conditions:** Address potential race conditions when accessing and modifying `current_value`.
*   **Encoder Steps:** Avoid directly manipulating `encoder.steps`.
*   **Shutdown Mechanism:** Implement a proper shutdown mechanism for the Flask app.

# === Static Analysis Feedback ===
The code has potential race conditions due to shared mutable state (`current_value`, `encoder.steps`) accessed by both interrupt handlers and API endpoints. The CORS configuration uses a wildcard, posing a security risk. Error handling is lacking, especially around GPIO operations. Unused imports bloat the code. Value constraints are duplicated. Debug mode is enabled in the production code. The function name `api_reset` is not descriptive. There is no logging.
Consider using a class to encapsulate the encoder logic and manage state, implement more specific CORS origins, add `try...except` blocks for error handling, remove unused imports, consolidate value constraints, disable debug mode in production, rename `api_reset` to something more descriptive, and add logging.
